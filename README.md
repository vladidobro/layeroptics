# layeroptics

Classical light propagation in 2D-translationally invariant structures described by permittivity tensors.
Calculations are based on the Berreman approach to 1D Maxwell equations.

- Reflection and transmission Jones matrices of general layered structures
- Gradients of Jones matrices with respect to permittivity tensor elements
  (useful e.g. for relating Kerr rotation to magneto-optical coefficients)
- In-plane magnetization in 2D Stoner-Wohlfarth models
- Waveguides (the incoming rays can have imaginary wavevectors)
- Arbitrarily rotated crystals (rotated permittivity tensors)
